12-10-2024 I've got the website running but still in progress of editing information on it and have finished reading Atomic Habits and The Shadow of the Gods, Book #1 in The Bloodsworn Trilogy by: John Gwynne. I'm now reading The hunger of the Gods, Book #2 in The Bloodsworn Trilogy and Before They are Hanged, Book #2 in The First Law Trilogy by: Joe Abercrombie. I haven't gotten rid of any books but bought a few more. Something i wasn't going to do. Shame. About 15 new books, 3 repeats since its the hardcover of books 1,2 and 3 of The Stormlight Archive by: Brandon Sanderson.
