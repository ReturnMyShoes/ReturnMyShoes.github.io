I'm trying to get my registered domain name digi.yo, to work with abs-digi.github.io. I tried yesterday, set it up like everbody said, waited 24hrs. and it didnt work. I've confirmed with Namecheap that my settings are correct today. Now im just waiting for github to work. Ive got the 4 A Records, Host DNS and one CNAME done. 




A Record: Host: @ Value: 185.199.108.153 Automatic, with variants of 109,110 and 111 to replace 108. The CNAME Record is Host: www Value: abs-digi.github.io TTL: Automatic.




I've got the CNAME file im my root repository showing: digi.yo


Now im just going to have to wait up to 24hrs. to see if it takes. The domain name might not work at all on github. With the .yo
